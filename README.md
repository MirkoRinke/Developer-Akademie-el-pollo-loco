### üìã Overview

Welcome to my ninth project as part of the Developer Academy and my very first object-oriented programming project! In this game, El Pollo Loco, I used object-oriented principles to create an exciting jump'n'run experience. Players navigate a character through challenging levels, avoiding obstacles and facing off against a giant, crazy chicken! With object-oriented code structuring, I was able to organize the game's characters, enemies, and game elements efficiently, resulting in a dynamic and interactive experience right in the browser.
